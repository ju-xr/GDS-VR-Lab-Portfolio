# GDS-VR-Lab-Portfolio

Here are the scripts I used my GDS VR Lab project to support my project portfolio website (https://www.mianzi-lizi.com/gdsvrlab). Most of the script is VR multiplayer-related that I made using Normcore and Oculus Interaction SDK, with some relatively complex code for me, so I just save here for later learning purposes.

Some of the code in the project is based on the sample project from both Normcore and Oculus, I jsut show the parts I have modified, and the other parts are functions I implemented.
